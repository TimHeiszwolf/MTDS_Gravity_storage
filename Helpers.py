    Makes a 3D plot like in the paper of Elke Klaasen (on the X axis the hours of the day, Y axis the days (of the year) and on the Z axis the actual value). Sadly makes a surface plot instead of a wireframe plot this is because the heatmap didn't work properly with the wireframe.
    
    function is the function of which it is going to make the wire plot
    amount_of_days is the amount of days you want the plot to coverting
    increments_in_day is the amount of steps during each day. Making this number large increases the x-axis accuracy of the plot but also increases computational time greatly.
